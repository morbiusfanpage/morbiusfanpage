<p>Ok so basically thereâ€™s this dude that likes bats and is crippled and a long time ago he met this kid and renamed him milo and apparently he's just ok with it and they are friends with the same cripple disease. Morbius makes a cure and it turns him into a vampire then he kills some dudes and says that milo shouldn't take it because its not safe. Milo steals it and morbius kills him and the movie ends. Also vulture is in the end credit scene and wants to make a team for who knows why.</p>
<h2>Really cool moments!</h2>
